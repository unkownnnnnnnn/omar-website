  <h1>I Have No Personality</h1>

  <p>I don’t really have a personality. I just pick things up from other people — whatever they're doing, whatever they're saying. I copy it, hoping it’ll make me feel something or be someone.</p>

  <p>When someone insults me, I remember it. Not because it hurt, but because I want to throw it back at someone else later. It doesn’t even matter if it makes sense — I just say things at random to people I hate, thinking maybe it’ll make me feel stronger, less invisible. It doesn’t.</p>

  <p>If I see people playing a game, I’ll start playing it too. Even if I don’t enjoy it. Even if I get bored. I just follow what others do. I pretend it’s fun because at least then I’m doing what “normal” people do.</p>

  <p>I don’t know what I like. I don’t know who I am. I just copy and repeat. Maybe one day I’ll find something real in the middle of all that noise. But right now, I’m just pieces of other people.</p>
