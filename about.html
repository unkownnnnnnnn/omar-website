  <h1>Omar's Parents</h1>

  <p>When I was born, my dad looked at my mom and said, “I’m going to get some milk.” He never came back. Just like that, he vanished from my life — no memories, no contact, just an empty space where a father should’ve been.</p>

  <p>That means I only have one parent. But it’s not what people imagine when they hear that. My mom is abusive. She insults me constantly, tells me I’m not a man, says I’m useless. There’s no kindness in her words — only sharp edges.</p>

  <p>She won’t even let me use the internet at home, not even to study. If I want to check something for school, I have to go outside in the heat and connect to public Wi-Fi. I stand there, sweating and tired, just to log into Outlook and see what I’m supposed to learn.</p>

  <p>This page isn’t for sympathy. It’s just the truth — part of my world, and why I made this site in the first place.</p>
